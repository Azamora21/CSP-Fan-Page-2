        <h1>Tabby's Star</h1>
        <a href="https://www.space.com/40836-tabbys-star-mystery-dimming-student-discovery.html"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/KIC_8462852_in_IR_and_UV.png" height=300 width=500 title="Tabbys Star" alt="Tabbys Star"> </a>
            <li>Unusual light fluctuations of the star, including up to a 22% dimming in brightness, were discovered by citizen scientists as part of the Planet Hunters project.</li>
            <li>Some scientists have wondered if we could instead be observing a giant structure built by an advanced civilization.</li>
            <li>The timing of the present dip suggests that whatever this material is, it is situated at just the right distance from the star to be in the “habitable zone,” where we believe that life like ours could develop as it has on Earth.</li>

        <h1>Dark Matter/Energy</h1>
        <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy"> <img src="https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2015/thedarksideo.png" height=300 width=500 title="Energy Distribution of the Universe" alt="Dark Matter/Energy"> </a>
            <li> It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%. </li>
            <li>One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing.</li>
            <li>Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: "empty space" can possess its own energy.</li>

        <h1>Gravitational Waves</h1>
        <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw"> <img src="https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA1My8xOTYvb3JpZ2luYWwvV2hhdC1Db2xsaWRpbmctQmxhY2stSG9sZXMtV2F2ZWZvcm1fd2ViLmpwZw==" height=300 width=500 title="Gravity Waves" alt="Ligo/Virgo"> </a>
            <li>Astronomers have directly detected elusive gravitational waves, 100 years after the existence of these spacetime ripples was first proposed by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. Scientists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) announced the find in a news conference on Feb. 11 2016.</li>
            <li>Gravitational waves are generated by the acceleration (or deceleration) of massive objects in the cosmos.</li>
            <li>LIGO physically sensed the distortions in spacetime caused by passing gravitational waves generated by two colliding black holes nearly 1.3 billion light years away></li>

        <h1>Bootes Void</h1>
        <a href="https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2013/07/30/jasons-blog-next-stop-voids/"> <img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--F-WbbukU--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gaofekzzq9qrbdve6rbx.jpg" height=300 width=500 title="CMB Map: Illustrating the Bootes Void" alt="Bootes Void"> </a>
            <li>The Boötes void is an enormous, approximately spherically-shaped region of space, containing very few galaxies. It is located in the vicinity of the constellation Boötes, hence its name.</li>
            <li>This monstrosity is around 500 million light years across and would be one of the largest structures in the visible Universe.</li>
            <li>At first, they were only able to find eight galaxies across the expanse, but further observations revealed a total of 60 galaxies.</li>
